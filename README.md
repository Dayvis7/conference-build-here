  # ANS 2021 SC Homepage

This repository is the location of the ANS 2021 Student Conference Homepage, hosted by the UIUC Chapter of the American Nuclear Society. It contains all of the source code used to publish the site in its current form.

## Getting Started for Committee Members

All changes to the source repository must be approved. As a result, members will fork the repository to make additions that will then be approved by the chairs.

### Prerequisites

To make edits to a fork of this file all you need is a github account, and intraductory (following the instructions for the contact us page can serve as a good introduction) knowledge of html and css. There are java script aspects, and a few other small bits outside of these two languages, but they should not limit a member's ability to contribute to the code.

It is recommended that you start by following the issue assigned to you specifically which prompts you to insert your photo and information into the contact us page of the site. The issue contains relatively detailed instructions as to how this can be done, and there are examples of the intended format already inplace. 

Relatively little knowledge of coding is required to complete this task, a CS 101 (and a little bit of google) knowledge is sufficient to operate within the site as it currently exists. This is intentional, as each committee memember is expected to contribute information specific to their site where relavent.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the Co-Chairs. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
